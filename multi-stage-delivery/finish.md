You’ve successfully split the process from the tooling. You’ve hidden the complexities of tooling API interaction. There are thousands of tool integrations already written for Keptn or write your own. Keptn comes out-of-the-box with microservices dedicated to self-healing and code quality gate workflows.

With Keptn it is incredibly easy to build complex task sequences whilst no longer worrying about the tooling that will implement those tasks.

- Try adding further tasks to your sequence
- Try sending a webhook to a third party tool instead of using the job executor service
- Build a full end-to-end delivery pipeline or any other sequence of tasks you can dream up
