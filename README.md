# Interactive Keptn Killercoda Scenarios

## About:
<b>Killercoda</b> is an Interactive Learning and Training Platform for Software Engineers to help learn new technologies using real environments right in the browser. It helps empowering developers to learn the technologies such as Kubernetes, Machine Learning and cloud platforms using self-paced labs. It shares knowledge with customised content and labs to demonstrate internal tooling, patterns and practices.

Visit https://killercoda.com/keptn/ to view the profile and interactive scenarios

## Impression:
We already have nice tutorials, you can find it from here [keptn-tutorials](https://tutorials.keptn.sh/). But it lacks the real time scenarios, we can extend this tutorial to provide users with the consequences of the use cases from the keptn project in real environment like web console through Killercoda Playground.

<b>Potential use-cases</b> that could be addressed in the project:

- With the support of Killercoda platform, each tutorial of keptn can be created and visualised smoothly. It would be nice if various kubernetes clusters can be integrated in the playground e.g. k3s, k3d, etc.
- Developer/Contributor playground for the keptn tutorial, in collaboration with the documentation/tutorial contributors.
