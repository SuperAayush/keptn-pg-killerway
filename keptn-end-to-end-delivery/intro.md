In this tutorial we'll set up the Podtato-head demo application which will feature different Prometheus metrics and deploy the application using multistage delivery. We will then use Keptn quality gates to evaluate the quality of the application based on SLO-driven quality gates.

# What we will cover:

- How to create a sample project and create a sample service
- How to setup quality gates
- How to use Prometheus metrics in our SLIs & SLOs
- How to prevent bad builds of your microservice to reach production

The full setup that we are going to deploy is sketched in the following image.
