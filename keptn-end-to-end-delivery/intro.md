# Keptn Multistage Delivery and Self-Healing with Helm, Prometheus, Locust and SLO-based Quality Gates
The goal of this tutorial is to:

- Deploy a microservice (using [helm](https://helm.sh))
- Generate load on the deployed service (using [locust](https://locust.io))
- Add approval gates into the delivery pipeline
- Add automated SLO-based quality evaluations both pre and post release
- Show how keptn can orchestrate self-healing patterns and tools (like scaling a helm deployment)

Keptn is unopinionated about tooling. A key strength of Keptn is it allows you to bring the tooling and observability platforms you already use and with which you are familiar.

That said, we needed to pick some tools and Helm + Locust are two modern and widely used tools.

We are using the Prometheus observability platform to provide data for our exercise. The process is very similar if you use a different data source (integrations are also currently available for Dynatrace and DataDog).

The tutorial will progress in steps:

1. Run automated tests the release our software into `qa` and `production` stages
2. Add an approval step to ensure a human must always click ‚Äúgo‚Äù before a production release
3. Replace the manual approval step with an automated quality gate. Add Prometheus to the cluster to monitor the workloads. Add SLO-based quality evaluations to ensure no bad build ever makes it to production
5. Add a quality evaluation in production, post rollout
6. Add a remediation action that will be taken by a remediation provider if an evaluation of the production stage fails. In the demo, this means helm scales the deployment

## While You're Waiting...

While you have been reading, we have been busy installing everything. It is still happening and should only take a few minutes.

While you wait, you will need a brand new uninitialised Git repo and personal access token to follow this tutorial.

You can use any Git provider but assuming you're using GitHub.com, follow the instructions below.

Let's get you setup while you wait for the install to finish:

- Go to GitHub token's [setting](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a personal access token with full `Repo` permissions

## Relax...

You have everything you need now and just need to wait for us to finish the installation.

Please wait here until you see the text `Installation Complete üéâ. Please proceed now.` in the console.

While you wait, here is a visual of what you are about to build.

It should only take a few more minutes...
