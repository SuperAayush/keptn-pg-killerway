# WAIT! You TRIGGERED HELLO, NOT HELLO-WORLD?

Correct: You triggered the sequence and Keptn handles the task execution for you.

## Uninstall Keptn

If you are done and want to uninstall the tutorial you can simply execute the following command

`k3s-uninstall.sh`{{execute}}

This will delete the k3s cluster including keptn.
If you also want to delete the git repository content you can also delete the local directory keptn-on-k3s
